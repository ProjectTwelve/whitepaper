To create an account, you may need to provide certain categories of personal information to us, such as a username, password, email address, birthdate, etc. You can also create an account using your pre-existing third-party accounts that we support, such as your Facebook account, as selected by you on the account creation screen.<br>

You acknowledge and agree not to include any words and phrases which are offensive in your display name. We reserve the right (but not obliged) to filter out certain impressions that we deem unacceptable. Besides, we also reserve the right to terminate your account or require you to register again with a new acceptable display name if we consider that the old one is offensive, misleading, or potentially infringing the rights of any third parties at our own discretion.<br>
#### 1.2 Ownership
The ownership of the account shall be owned by us, and you shall only enjoy the right to use the account during the term of this Agreement. Your account is only for your own non-commercial use. Without our consent, you may not sell, resell, rent, lease, share or provide access to your account to anyone else. We will not be responsible for any losses that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and/or using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised use, whether fraudulently or otherwise. Besides, we reserve all available legal rights and remedies to prevent unauthorized use of our Services. Your account may be suspended or terminated if someone else uses it to engage in activity that violates this Agreement.

Also, you acknowledge that you shall be responsible for all behaviors performed and identified on or through your account, whether authorized by you. If you find someone using your account without permission or any other security vulnerabilities, you should immediately notify us.<br>

You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of your account information. We would recommend that you regularly change your password, and do not use the same email and password combination for any other online service.<br>

If your account is inactive (i.e., not used or logged-into) for a period of time, we will notify you via the Services prior to termination of your Account.<br>

You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us at [support@p12.dev](mailto:support@p12.dev). To complete your request, we may collect fees incurred, if allowed by law, and any amounts owed to third-party vendors, service providers or creators.<br>

Subject to applicable foreign exchange control regulations in your jurisdiction, we may offer certain upgrades and options within our Services that you can buy with real world currency, including, but not limited to, in-app currency where permitted under applicable law (“Virtual Currency”), in-app items or abilities, digital items for avatars, and other such digital add-on items that may improve your experience in some way (“Virtual Items”). Please note that Virtual Currency does not have any value in real currency, which means it is not a substitute for real currency and it doesn't earn interest. Except as otherwise outlined in the Terms, Virtual Currency can't be redeemed for any other currency and we are not obligated to exchange users' currency for anything else of value. Users under the age of 18 are required to obtain parental consent before purchasing Virtual Currency.<br>

All payments for Virtual Currency and Virtual Items are final and non-refundable, except as required by law.

We do not recognize or take responsibility for third-party services that allow you to sell, transfer, or otherwise use Virtual Currency and any such use by a user is a violation of the Terms.<br>

When purchasing Virtual Currency or Premium Memberships from our Services, you (or your guardian, as applicable) promise that you have the right to use your selected payment method and that your payment method has enough credit available to complete the applicable payment. If you believe someone has gained access to or used your account without permission, please notify us as soon as possible via [support@p12.dev](mailto:support@p12.dev). For the purposes of protecting our legitimate interests, we reserve the right to terminate any account with unauthorized charges.<br>

Upon your purchase of Virtual Currency, you only receive a limited, non-refundable, non-transferable, revocable license to use it only for your personal entertainment, in connection with the Services, and in the ways permitted by us in the applicable Terms. Your license to use Virtual Currency will end when these Terms or your account terminate, or in any other way outlined in the Terms. You may get a limited license to use Virtual Currency: <br>
(a) by purchasing or otherwise receiving Virtual Currency from us; <br>
(b) by buying memberships that include an amount of Virtual Currency; <br>
(c) by selling User Generated Content ("UGC") on the Services; <br>
(d) by trading items with other users; or <br>
(e) through other ways that we may sometimes offer.<br>
#### 4.3 Changes to Virtual Items and Virtual Currency
Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, we, in our sole discretion, may modify, substitute, replace, suspend, cancel or eliminate any Virtual Items or Virtual Currency, including your ability to access or use Virtual Items or Virtual Currency, without notice or liability to you. We do not make any guarantees regarding Virtual Items or Virtual Currency, or their availability, quality, stability or value.

You may, from time to time, make payments to us or other third parties in relation to the Virtual Items and/or Virtual Currency.

However, we can block, delete, edit, or block any UGC that we believe violates the Agreement or is otherwise objectionable at any time without prior notice. You understand that when using this service, you will encounter UGC from different sources and admit that UGC may be inaccurate, offensive, or indecent. You agree to give up and do give up any legal or fair claims and compensation you have or may have with respect to UGC. Where the user or UGC owner informs us that the UGC is suspected of violating this Agreement, we can investigate the relevant charges and decide whether to delete the UGC at our own discretion. We reserve the right to delete it at any time without further notice. For the sake of clarity, we do not allow copyright infringement activities on services.

### 14. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration And No Class Actions
#### 14.1 Disputes Between Users & Creators
If a user has any issues with the experiences, Virtual Items or other UGC created by Creators, it should first contact the Creator directly to resolve the issue. While we are not responsible for these types of issues between Users and Creators, we want to make sure that everyone enjoys our Services. As a result, we have the right (but not obligation) to intervene in issues between Users and Creators so that we can try to help resolve them. Before escalating any issues between a User and Creator to P12 App, Users should first make a real, genuine effort to work out a solution with the Creator. If the User does not succeed, the User may escalate the issue to P12 App. If we choose to take action in any dispute between a User and Creator, the User and Creator agree that P12 App's decision is final and the Creator and User will accept that decision. Users agree to work with P12 App in a timely manner to resolve all such issues, and failure to do so is a violation of these Terms.
#### 14.2 General Disputes
If there is a dispute about something covered by the Terms, it will be handled based on the version of the Terms that applied when the dispute happened. "Dispute" means any dispute, action, or claim relating to any part of the Terms, including those that come up after the Terms or a certain user's account terminates. Stay up to date by checking the Terms.
#### 14.3 No Class Actions and Severability
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement will still apply.
#### 14.4 Arbitration of Disputes
If a User and we are in a dispute, other than for those disputes listed below, the User and we agree to first try to resolve the dispute through informal discussions for at least 60 days. Those informal discussions will start when written notice is sent from the User to us or from us to the User. Users and we shall send a notice to each other via email. If, after 60 days, the User and we don't resolve the dispute, the User and we each agree to handle all disputes through binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator and that the arbitrator has the exclusive right to resolve any dispute, including whether any part of the Terms is void or voidable.
#### 14.5 Governing Law and Forum Choice
You agree that laws of the Republic of Singapore (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) will govern these Terms, their subject matter, and their formation. Any dispute arising out of, from, or relating to these Terms or the Services, including any question regarding existence, validity or termination of these Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this Section. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The tribunal shall consist of no more than three (3) arbitrators. The language of arbitration shall be English. The initiating party is responsible for filing fees and all other fees. Any disputes that are not subject to the Arbitration Terms or that are severed from any arbitration may only be litigated in any competent courts of Singapore.
